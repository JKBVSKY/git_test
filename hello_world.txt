Living throughout the late Cretaceous, Quetzalcoatlus northropi could grow to have a wingspan of up to 36 feetâ€” about the size of a standard city bus. Early scientists estimated that this species of pterosaur may have weighed anywhere from 200 to 500 pounds.
A T. rex is about 32x more massive than a Quetzalcoatlus, which would be equivalent to a 2kg sharp object falling onto a human from a great height. There are reports of humans being killed by falling icicles which are probably lighter than that, and at least one case of a woman being injured when a 1 kg duck fell out of the sky and landed on her.
A Quetzalcoatlus would need to be extraordinarily lucky to kill a Tyrannosaurus, assuming that the dinosaur is an adult.

Theoretically, the pterosaur could deal a fatal peck and sever a major artery, or bring down the dinosaurian menace indirectly by blinding it. But both of those seem like stretches.

But a Quetzalcoatlus would really have no reason to fight a Tyrannosaurus: pterosaurs were capable of extremely quick takeoffs (in the air in 2 seconds from a standing start), and once in the air, could fly around 50 mph (80 kph). The dinosaur, capable of only about 22 mph, has virtually no hope of getting those supersize wings if the dactyl has more than two seconds of warning.
