			<!-- Welcoming message -->

			<h2>Hello Adventurers! My name is <mark>Kuba</mark> and I will tell You some interesting facts about the dinosaurs!</h2>

				<!-- Content -->

				<h2>Carnivores</h2>
					<ol>
						<li><h3>Tyrannosaurus Rex</h3></li>
							<p>This dinosaur's massive jaws were lined with 50-60 serrated teeth, some measuring 9 inches long. Preserved bone and muscle fragments in T. rex feces show that it took big, bone-crushing bites consuming <strong>up to 500 lbs of meat in one bite!</strong> Its 4-foot-long jaws were big enough to swallow an adult human!</p>

						<li><h3>Velociraptor</h3></li>
							<p>These smart dinos had a large brain that helped them be very agile. They could also <strong>hunt together in packs!</strong> Working together they were fearsome predators. It would have been almost <strong>impossible</strong> to escape from their attack. Velociraptors had very powerful back legs with long claws that could rip into their prey. These claws were lifted back when they were running.</p>

						<li><h3>Allosaurus</h3></li>
							<p>Building in progress...</p>
